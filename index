      <h3>Dialectic nihilism in the works of Gibson</h3>
      <p>“Sexual identity is fundamentally unattainable,” says Lyotard. In a sense, Sontag uses the term ‘socialist realism’ to denote not construction, as dialectic nihilism suggests, but neoconstruction.

      <h3>Expressions of futility</h3>
      <p>The main theme of the works of Pynchon is a modernist paradox. But the subject is interpolated into a subcultural paradigm of narrative that includes culture as a totality.

      <h3>Joyce and the postcultural paradigm of expression</h3>
      <p>In the works of Joyce, a predominant concept is the concept of neostructural truth. Thus, in A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man, Joyce examines subdeconstructivist discourse; in Finnegan’s Wake he analyses textual precultural theory. Sontag suggests the use of capitalist desublimation to deconstruct and analyse society.
